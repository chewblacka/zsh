# zsh

## Install
To install:
1. Clone this repository into your `$HOME` directory:
```Sh
git clone https://github.com/chewblacka/zsh.git zsh
```
2. Then run the install script:
```Sh
./zsh/.github/install.sh
```
The install script installs [antidote](https://getantidote.github.io/)
which then installs and manages my zsh plugins including 
[romkatv's powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) zsh theme.
On first run p10k run it's setup script allowing you to customize the look & feel of zsh.
